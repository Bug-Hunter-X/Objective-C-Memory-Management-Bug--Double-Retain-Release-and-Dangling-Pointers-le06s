The improved `setString:` method addresses the double retain issue and handles the potential `nil` value:

```objectivec
- (void)setString:(NSString *)string {
    if (myString != string) {
        [myString release];
        if (string) {
            myString = [string retain];
        } else {
            myString = nil;
        }
    }
}
```

Adding a check for `nil` prevents the double release.  Also, using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) is highly recommended for modern Objective-C projects as it simplifies memory management and eliminates such errors. To enable ARC, simply add `-fobjc-arc` to the compiler settings. This eliminates the need for manual retain and release calls.
